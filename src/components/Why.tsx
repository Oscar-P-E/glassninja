      <p className="mb-4">
        Hi, I hope you’re well. My name’s Oliver, and Glass Ninja is a new
        professional window cleaning service that I’ve opened on the Sunshine
        Coast. Glass Ninja was born from a passion for window cleaning, and the
        desire to serve Aussies on the Sunny Coast.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        “Passion for window cleaning?” Let me explain. Clean glass brightens
        your whole home or business, and raises its perceived value immensely.
        You ever get that feeling that a place is just dirty or shabby, but you
        don’t actually see it directly? That’s the windows! When glass is dirty,
        all the light that filters through it is spoiled, and that filters out
        everywhere. You’re surrounded and coated in dirt-light. It’s like
        wearing dirty sunglasses:{" "}
        <span className="font-bolder">
          you don’t realise how bad it is until after you wipe them clean!
        </span>{" "}
        It’s the same thing with windows, and it’s a real silent mood killer.
        And just like wearing dirty sunnies, you won’t realise how much better
        and brighter it all is until after that dirty glass is properly cleaned.
        And that’s the effect I want to show to home residents, businesses and
        their clients.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The problem is, windows are really hard to clean right. You can scrub
        and scrub but as soon as you tilt your head you see more smudges and
        streaks than before. If you go too rough on your windows you can easily
        permanently damage them. And some windows are just outright dangerous to
        even try to climb and reach. And don’t get me started on over the
        counter window sprays. Let’s just say they are the laughing-stock of the
        professional window cleaning world. And trust me, whatever chemicals
        you’re buying, they may help a little on the day, but each time you’re
        adding another clear layer of sticky chemicals which attract and gunk up
        more oil and dirt the next time, especially on the outside. You can’t
        hide anything with windows, they’re the trickiest thing to get perfect.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        That’s where professionals like Glass Ninja come in. Let us show you
        that it’s worth it to get a regular professional clean, because nothing
        else comes close to lifting up the entire place like clean glass.
